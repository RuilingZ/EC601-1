In this project, our target is to build a social media analyzer. The application gets tweets by Twitter API and analyzes sentiment by Google Natural Language API. The user of this application will be someone who wants to know comments on some topics, some projects, or something others. The user may also be someone who wants to know the comments of some famous people, some professors, or someone others. In short, the user of this application always focuses on others' comments to something or someone or just focuses on someone's life.

As a person who wants to know more about someone or something, he will require the application can search keywords and show what it has found. Moreover, it is better if the application can detect what are positive comments and what are negative comments, and give an overall grade for the keywords. The search area can be limited by date or area.

As a person who wants to know someone's life, he will require the application can search by a username and return the timeline of the account. Moreover, it is also better if the application can detect when the user is happy or sad, and give an overall grade for the user. The search area can also be limited by date or area.

In conclusion, the application should search, analyze and give feedback. The minimum viable product should be searching and return what it has found to the user.
